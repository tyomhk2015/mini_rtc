WebRTC w/ Web Sockets

---

**HTTP**
* HTTP is `stateless` protocol, meaning the server do not know who the current user is once it finishes handling the client's request.
* The server only reacts when there is a request, otherwise in idle. (1:1 communication)

**Web Socket**
* One of protocols for communicating between a server and clients.
<pre>
  For connection, wss://domain.blah or ws://domain.blah
</pre>
* Once connected w/ WSS, the server remembers the connected user, and can send messages prior to the client's request. (No more 1:1 of req and res!)
* The connection is two-way direction, server can send many signals and at any point, arbitrarily. So do the client. (N:N communication)

* Implementing WebSocket is more similar to adding events at the frontEnd, not like HTTPs.

**Glossary**
* Implementation
<br>
Following some rules for building something and turn it into code.

**Socket IO**

Homepage : https://socket.io/

* Not an implementation of WebSocket.
* This is a framework/library supporting `real-time`, `bidirectional`, and `event-driven` communication for Front-end and Back-end.
* If there are browsers that do not support `WebSocket`, this framework will help those browsers to achieive real-time communication by other methods.
* Pros: You do not need to implement all the technial features, you need, from scratch.
<br>E.g) Reconnect to the server when the connection is disconnected.

üí° Adapter

* Resource: https://socket.io/docs/v4/glossary/#adapter
* Synchronize you RTC applications among the other servers.

**WebRTC**

* Prequisite
1. Get video/camera from user to show it on the screen.
2. Mute/Unmute, Camera On/Off, Rear/Front camera mode triggers.
3. Permission for using media devices must be allowed.

üìù Note
* If one browser is using the media of the device, camera, the other browser cannot get the information about the device because it is already occupied.
<pre>
An Error
In Chrome & Edge:
  DOMException: Could not start video source

In FireFox:
  DOMException: Failed to allocate videosource
</pre>

* Stream give different tracks, like audio,video, subtitle etc.
* MediaDevices: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices

üí° Peer-to-Peer (P2P)
* A system that do not need a central DB, for transmitting audios / videos / text.
* Your computer, or node, will be a client and a server at the same time.
* WebRTC allows us to make P2P connections.

* The need of a server on P2P system; signaling.
<br>To enable clients to find connection settings for communicating with other clients. (Eg. Browser, Port, IP, Location, OS ... etc)

üí° Steps for building webRTC

<img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/1*hQHzaT-JB1Wx3y0qtQX8Kw.png" style="background: white;">

* Negotiating the mean of communcating with ICEcandidate, between peers, is mandatory.

üõ† **Troubleshooting**
<br>
‚ùå Problem

* Safari browser was not showing peer's camera in the video tag.

<br>
üîé Reason

* 'addstream' event of `RTCPeerConnection` was deprecated.

<br>
‚úÖ Solution

* Added the event listener `track`, instead of `addstream`, on the `RTCPeerConnection` object.
* In the `srcObject` of video tag DOM, put `Mediastream`.
